We have far-fetched dreams of making TinkerHub the community one thinks of,
when needing any form of assistance, but during our initial stages, our main focus
lies in implementing the following:
1. Setup Internship Opportunities
●
Being a community driven platform, anyone from anywhere will be
exposed to all the internship opportunities that are out there.
●
Organisations can use it as a platform to see the students in all their
merit, and choose to reward those who they see worthy.
2. Hackathons
●
These enable students to let their ideas flow and come up with
outstanding innovations, which later can be improvised into something
that gives back to the society.
3. Sessions
●
We do plan to host sessions, about relevant advancements in software
and hardware technologies, to render the attendees capable of
employing the same into their projects/activities.
4. Projects
●
We aim to start out projects, that give back to the society. And this
would be the right platform, involving multifaceted people, with an
extravaganza of ideas, mentored by the best in the nation.
5. Patents
●
Something all educational institutions need to focus on is research
output and innovation that arises from the institution. We plan to
network with a larger community to make this happen.
6. Regular Meetings
●
As any active community should, we stress on having regular meetings
amongst the members.3
7. Mentoring and Support
●
Since we are an open community, the amount of mentorship that we
can provide is something to be reckoned with. From junior and and
final year students, to leading industry professionals, the network is
strong and waiting for fresh talent.
